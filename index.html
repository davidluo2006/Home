      <p> I stayed in China for 6 years before my parents decided to immigrate to Canada.
         We immigrated here when on the july of 2012. At first, it was pretty difficult because my mom was the only person in 
         our family who spoke and understood english. Luckily, we eventually got use to living in Canada.
      </p>
      <h2>My Elementary School Years:</h2>
      <p>I started grade one in Canada when I was 6. At the time, it school was really hard for me as I barely understood english.
         However, I got placed into ESL (english second language) program and as time went on, my english skills gradually improved. By the end of grade 3,
         I was no longer required to go the ESL classes.

      <h2>My Middle School Years:</h2>
      <p>I went to Donview Middle Schol as my first middle school. There, I would make lots of friends, some of them, I still am in contact with to this day. This school was also the place where my love for basketball started. During the beginning of my grade 8 year at Donview, my parents and I moved to another location.
         As a result, I graduated middle school at St.Andrews Middle School.
      <p>
      <h2>My High School Years:</h2>
      <p>I am currently at Victoria Park C.I. for my freshmen year of highschool. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic that is still going on at the time of creating this website
         I am currently going to school on a 4 day scheduel, in which we go to school every other day and stay home and do online learning during
