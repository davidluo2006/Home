      <h1>My Future Goals</h1>
      <p>Now that you know a bit more about my past, I will now share some of the things I want to do in the future.
      </p>
      <p>A lot of these carrier goals are realistic goals but a few of them may be very unrealistic. I believe setting high goals like these make achieving
         the more realistic goals easier

      <h2>Career Goals</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>A Doctor</li>
         <li>A Biologist</li>
         <li>A Software Developer</li>
         <li>A Professional Athlete</li>
         <li>A Lawyer</li>
         <li>A Content Creator</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why do I want to become a ...</h2>
      <h3>Doctor</h3>
      <img src="html images/image-2.jpg" alt="A image of a doctor">
      <p>I want to become a doctor because it is a very high skill demanding job. This means by achiving this goal, I will have to develop very good habits, which
         will make me a better person. In addition, I get to help other people and get a very good salary while doing so.
      <p>
      <h3>Biologist</h3>
      <img src="html images/image-3.jpg" alt="A image of a biologist">
      <p>I want to become a biologist because I am very interested in living things. I find nature as a very beautiful thing and would love to have job that's dedicated
         to studying it. Although the requirements for this carrier are not as high as my other carrier goals, the anual salary from this job is still quite good. 
      </p>
      <h3>Software Developer</h3>
      <img src="html images/image-4.jpg" alt="A image of a software developer">
      <p>I want to become a Software Developer because I recently learned some basic coding languages and want to learn more about those languages (and other coding languages) so
         I can develop and create my own software. I would like to develop video games the most as I play them a lot and have some ideas in my head which I would like to use coding to 
         bring to life. The salary of a software developer is also pretty good.
      <h3>Professional Athlete</h3>
      <img src="html images/image-5.jpg" alt="A image of a professional athlete">
      <p>I want to become a professional athlete because I really enjoy sports, especially basketball and track and field. I also am very good at both these sports making my chances 
         to become a professional athlete a lot higher than the average person. However, I do understand that at the highest level of sports, most things are mainly based on natural talent and genetics.
         It still would be a dream come true if this could be my future carrier but I do have other carrier options in case I don't achieve this goal.
      </p>
      <h3>Lawyer</h3>
      <img src="html images/image-6.jpg" alt="A image of a lawyer" width="25%" height="25%">
      <p>I want to become a lawyer because I would like to help people who need protection from the law or people who got on the wrong side of the law. The salary for a lawyer is also quite high which is a bonus.</P>
      <h3>Content Creator</h3>
      <img src="html images/image-7.jpg" alt="A image of a content creator" width="30%" height="30%">
      <p>I want to become a content creator because I want to help entertian others while being myself. By being a content creator, I will have a lot more freedom
         on when I work and do other things. The downside to being a content creator is that the job is a lot less reliable than all my other career goals. As a result, it is also one of my 
         unrealistic goals.
